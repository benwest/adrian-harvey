Text: I’m between novels. My first, Being Someone, was published in May last year and my next, The Cursing Stone, will be published in May 2016, again by the lovely Urbane Publications. So there is something of a lull in output and, to fill the void, I’ve published a short story, Fuse, which you can read for free here. It’s inspired by my home town, although any resemblance to real persons or events is purely coincidental. I’d love to know what you think.
