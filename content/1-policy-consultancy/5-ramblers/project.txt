Text: The walking charity (link: http://www.ramblers.org.uk/ text: Ramblers) collected a massive data set on the condition of the countryâ€™s public rights of way through their Big Pathway check app. They commissioned me to analyse the data and to draft the final report, (link: http://www.ramblers.org.uk/get-involved/pathwatch/the-state-of-our-paths-report.aspx text: The Big Pathwatch: The State of Our Paths), which was published in November 2016 and launched a major public-facing campaign.
