Text: I’m an Associate of the (link: http://www.nlgn.org.uk/public/ text: New Local Government Network), a think tank that does what you’d expect it to, and regularly help them with projects, from supporting local authorities directly as they respond to the difficult circumstances they face, to writing research reports on a range of policy issues around places and local service. For example, I helped a consortium of local authorities develop their plans for a bid to Government for a ‘Devolution Deal’, I wrote a short pamphlet on arts funding cut, and more recently I wrote a pamphlet on how good urban design in new housing developments can improve social and economic outcomes.
